# BlockChain Concepts

## 1. Distributed Ledgers

A public ledger will typically give all relevant information about a transaction and its participants. There's nowhere to hide because it's all out in the open. The justification for private or federated blockchain, on the other hand, is a little different. However, in certain circumstances, a large number of people can observe what is really going on in the ledger.

Because the network's ledger is maintained by all other users on the system, this is the case. To achieve a better result, the computational power was divided throughout the computers.

This is why it's regarded one of the blockchain's most important characteristics. The end outcome will always be a more efficient ledger system capable of competing with traditional ledger systems.

## 2. Consensus

The consensus is a decision-making procedure for the network's active nodes. The nodes can reach a consensus immediately and relatively quickly in this case. A consensus is required for a system to work smoothly when millions of nodes are validating a transaction. It's similar to a voting system in which the majority wins and the minority is forced to support it.

The lack of trust in the network is due to the consensus. Nodes may not trust each other, but the algorithms at the heart of the system may be trusted. As a result, every network choice is a win-win situation for the blockchain. It's one of the advantages of blockchain technology.

## 3. Smart contract

Smart Contracts are particularly important in the Blockchain since they help to make transactions more safe and secure, as well as more organized. Not only that, but it also makes other components, such as apps that run on these platforms, more accessible.
